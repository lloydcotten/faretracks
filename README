What is FareTracks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FareTracks is a browser extension and online service that allows users to 
detect airfares as they search for them and track them on a web site.  The
web site provides them with cumulative statistics and trends of airfares.


Project State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A first prototype written using Python in April 2010 proved the concept.
However, a different distribution model is necessary.

Using browser extensions, and detecting fares using Javascript, we can
now move forward with this project.


Project Roadmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a project that is being worked on in the spare time.  Progress
will be slow and updates will occur has it is convenient for me.
